    <h4>
        from lofy skies, provisions gently fall, <br>
        Through paths unknown, unseen  by all. <br>
        When hands give freely, the souls feel light,<br>
        And Allah replies with grace and might.<br>
        <br><br>
        Behind a simple act to lift the weak,<br>
        Lies rewards far more than we dare to seek.<br>
        Not always wealth, but guidance shines,<br>
        or lasting health---His perfect signs.<br>
        <br><br>
        How Merciful You are, O Lord Most Kind,<br>
        To hear the whispers in a servent's mind.<br>
        A small act done with love and grace,<br>
        You return it in countless, silent ways.<br>
        <br><br>
        No deed is lost, no goodness vain,<br>
        You sends Your gifts like healing rain.<br>
        Indeed, You see what others miss,<br>
        And bless the hearts that seek no praise or bliss.<br>
        <br><br>
        O Allah, keep this heart sincere and true,<br>
        To give with joy, expecting naught in view.<br>
        Protect from pride, from wordly claim,<br>
        So each good deed upholds Your name.<br>
        <br><br>
        Let every help become a stair,<br>
        To each Your mercy, pure and fair.<br>
        For truly, none gives like You do---<br>
        Faithful, just, and always true.<br>
